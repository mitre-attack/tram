# TRAM v0.5

Threat Report ATT&CK<sup>®</sup> Mapping (TRAM) is a tool to aid analyst in mapping finished reports to ATT&CK. TRAM is currently in its beta phase and is actively being developed.
​

## Quick run with Docker

In order to run the application in detached mode on port 80 execute following command:

```
docker run -d -p 80:9999 1402/mitre-attack-tram:latest

```

## Requirements
- [python3](https://www.python.org/) (3.7+)
- Google Chrome is our only supported/tested browser

## Installation
Start by cloning this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/mitre-attack/tram.git
```
From the root of this project, install the PIP requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then start the server.
```
python tram.py
```
Once the server has started, point your browser to localhost:9999, and you can then enter a URL on the home page.
It currently takes several minutes to analyze a report, so please do not leave the page while it processes.

Configuration defaults can be changed [here](https://github.com/mitre-attack/tram/wiki/TRAM-Configuration)

## Intended Use
Please note that TRAM is currently intended to be used as a local, single user application. We are aware of the benefit of using the application in a centralized location for multiple analysts to access at once, and will work in the future to add features to make this viable.

## How do I contribute?

We welcome all the help we can get in making TRAM a more useful tool for the community. We have made a working prototype and acknowledge that there will need to be increased efforts in the future to maintain and improve it.
